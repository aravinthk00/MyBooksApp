# 📚 MyBooks – Flutter App

**MyBooks** is a Flutter application that allows users to browse and manage their favorite novels. It integrates the OpenLibrary API to fetch books under the "novel" subject and provides features like pagination, book detail views, and favorites management.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 View a list of novels
- 📄 Detailed book info
- ⭐ Mark/unmark books as favorites
- 📑 Favorites screen
- 🔁 Pagination with infinite scroll
- 📱 Responsive across devices
- ⚠️ Error handling and no data UI

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer (API models).
- **ViewModel (Provider)**: Manages business logic and state.
- **View**: The UI widgets (screens, components).

> This structure promotes better separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.

## 🌐 API Reference

- Endpoint: `https://openlibrary.org/subjects/novel.json`
- Method: `GET`
- Params: `limit`, `offset`
- Response: `works` (List of books)

---

## 🧠 Design & Decisions

- **Provider** was chosen over Bloc for simplicity and flexibility in state management.
- API interaction is abstracted in `ApiService` to separate concerns.
- Pagination is implemented using `ScrollController` to fetch additional data when the user nears the bottom of the list.
- Local state holds the favorites list; in future versions, it can be persisted using `shared_preferences` or `hive`.
- Error and loading states are handled using conditional rendering to improve UX.
